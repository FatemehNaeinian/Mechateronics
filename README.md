# Fundamentals of Mechatronics Engineering

This repository contains projects and simulations developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Mechatronics Engineering" course. The course covered various aspects of mechatronics, and here are the key highlights:

1. **Robot Simulation with MATLAB and Simscape:**
   - Simulated a robot using the Simscape tool in MATLAB.
   - Calculated critical parameters such as Jacobian, Workspace, and Singular Regions to analyze and control the robot's motion.

2. **Kinematics Analysis for a Robot:**
   - Calculated Inverse Kinematics and Forward Kinematics for a robot.
   - Utilized the Denavit-Hartenberg table to establish the kinematic relationships necessary for robot control.

3. **Hand Rotation Simulation with VPython and Arduino:**
   - Developed a simulation of hand rotation using VPython.
   - Integrated an Arduino board and gyroscope sensor to capture and replicate hand movements.
   - This project likely involved the design of interactive hand movements through a virtual environment.

These projects provided practical experience in mechatronics engineering, including robot modeling, kinematics analysis, and sensor integration. 

Feel free to explore the individual project folders within this repository for more details and code implementations.
